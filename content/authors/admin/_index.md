I am a PhD student at the Socio-Economic Panel at the German Institute for Economic Research and the Chair of Empirical Economics at the University of Potsdam. Moreover, I am associated with the Center for Economic Policy Analysis.

My research interests center on the socioeconomic determinants of health, social mobility and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary interests include economics of immigration.
